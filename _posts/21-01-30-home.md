Thanks for visiting my website. I am a graduate student in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and am advised by <a href="https://www.atmos.illinois.edu/~nriemer/">Dr. Nicole Riemer</a>.

My research focuses on the application of the particle-resolved aerosol model PartMC to high spatial resolution studies. Traditional methods for modeling aerosols tend to use simplified representations of aerosol species and coarse spatial resolutions. In turn, these methods tend to underrepresent the spatial heterogeneity of aerosols and associated chemical reactions. My work involves extending PartMC to implement large eddy simulation modeling, allowing particle-resolved simulations at high spatial resolution. This novel approach fills a gap in aerosol modeling research, and allows greater characterization of modeling uncertainties present in existing methods.
