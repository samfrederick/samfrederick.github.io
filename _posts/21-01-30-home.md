Thanks for visiting my website. I am a passionate researcher with interests in astrophysics, data analysis, and seeking solutions to critical air quality issues including access to reliable, actionable air sensor data.

I work as a post-baccalaureate contractor with [ORAU](https://www.orau.org/index.html) for [U.S EPA's Office of Research and Development](https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/about-office-research-and-development-ord) where I evaluate the performance of air quality sensors against federal reference methods for monitoring criteria pollutants. I also work with EPA colleagues to establish and implement performance targets, metrics, and protocols for the evaluation of air sensors used in fixed-site, ambient outdoor settings.

I graduated in May 2019 from [Davidson College](https://www.davidson.edu) with a B.S. in Physics.
In my senior year, I completed a [thesis](https://samfrederick.github.io/media/docs/frederick-thesis.pdf) under the the advisement of [Dr. Kristen Thompson](https://www.davidson.edu/people/kristen-thompson) and [Dr. Michelle Kuchera](https://www.davidson.edu/people/michelle-kuchera). I constructed a C-based model of highly magnetic pulsars and used magnetohydrodynamic simulations to calculate the structural deformations of these objects. More information about my thesis and other recent work can be found on the [Projects](https://samfrederick.github.io/projects) page.
